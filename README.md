# Cleaning Data for use in Machine Learning

In this project I chose some data about YouTube videos and some of their given metrics. I wanted to explore and clean the data ready for some later use in machine learning.


### Exploration: 

In this project there are two notebooks. The one titled data_cleaning walks through my process of inital data inspection and then organising the data to be more useful in some data analysis.
One of the main challanges I faced here was writing a helper function to get data on what each category_ID number meant so that I could make any kind of meaningful comparisson later on.

### Analysis:

Even though the original scope of this project was just to clean the data I decided to make a seperate notebook and do some work on Data Visualisation. In it you can see me walkthrough some of the Data Compraissons I would believe are usefull if you wanted to set up a new YouTube channel

### Requirements:

All required libraries are in _requirements.txt_ and can be installed using pip.
