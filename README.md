# Cleaning Data for use in Machine Learning

In this work I will take in a dataset I have sourced from online, examine it and clean it ready for use in my upcoming work on machine learning.

### Project Scoping:

* **Project Goals:** To clean data ready for use in machine learning
* **Data:** Some YouTube Data to analyze, Let's say hypothetically someone wanting to start a sucessfull channel wanted to know about key upload times, video length vs engagement and other things.
* **Analysis:** while most of the code might be written into helper functions. A good exploration in a notebook would probably be good.
* **Evaluation:**
* **Output:**
